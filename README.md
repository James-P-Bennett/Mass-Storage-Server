Mass Storage Server is a lightweight Minecraft plugin inspired by AE2 and Refined Storage mod. Designed to provide expandable item storage through craftable removable drives. This early beta release introduces basic functionality and and several items that can be crafted in the vanilla recipe book or obtained via the /mss command.

Each drive is uniquely identified and tied to a dedicated storage pool managed by a fast and efficient SQLite database using HikariCP. Items stored in these drives can be accessed through a terminal interface, which is capable of handling multiple users concurrently (theoretically without conflict).

This plugin is still in active development and has a long way to go before it's really published on any platform.
Please use at your own risk and report any bugs in the issues tracker.
